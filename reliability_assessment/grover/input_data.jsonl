Trump also suggested that he was open to shutting down the government again if negotiations on an agreement to fund border security prove fruitless.\n\"If we don't get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on Feb. 15 or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency,\" he said.\nThe comments came a day after the president softened his public demands for border wall funding during an Oval Office meeting with Democratic leaders in which he compromised on the number of miles of barriers built.

About 420,000 federal workers missed their first paychecks Friday under the shutdown.\nRepublican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, a frequent Trump critic, said the shutdown situation was \"unbelievably sad,\" noting that it stemmed from disagreements over immigration policy.\n\"I look forward to taking action to reopen the government,\" he said.\nTrump has been adamant that he will not sign legislation that doesn't include funding for a border wall, even as most Republicans have said they will not support such a measure. The funding fight is being driven by an impasse over Trump's demands for $5.7 billion for wall construction, which Democrats have refused to give.\nTrump said during the meeting Monday that there was \"no way\" he would extend a temporary spending bill that Congress passed in early February and sent to him. He also argued that it was the Democrats who are intransigent.\nTrump was joined in the Oval Office by a small group of congressional Republicans who are trying to woo him into backing off the wall demand.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado urged Trump to reopen closed parts of the government with temporary funding until lawmakers can work out a border security compromise.\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York asked if Trump had any \"amendments\" to his proposal.\n\"It's a nonstarter,\" Trump said.\nGraham told CNN Tuesday that Trump should reconsider, \"if it will save lives, if it will save law enforcement officers' hours, if it will save liberty by being able to say to our friends in the Middle East and China, 'We fixed the border,'\" he said.\nGraham also said he'd be willing to serve as a mediator between the two sides.\nDuring a fundraiser for the Republican National Committee in Mesa, Arizona, on Monday, Graham was asked about prospects for a deal, and he responded, \"I am so convinced we're going to have a deal. It is not going to be along the lines of 'build a wall and you're done.'\"\nAssociated Press writers Pauline Jelinek in Washington and Ken Thomas in Mesa, Arizona, contributed to this report.\n",
